# airbnb-rental-price-prediction

People interested in renting an apartment or home share information about themselves and their property on Airbnb. Those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset contains information on 90 variables related to the property, host, and reviews for over 35,000 Airbnb rentals in New York.

The goal is to construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set of Airbnb rentals.

The result will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error).
